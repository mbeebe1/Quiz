This project asked us to build a coding quiz from scratch. When you press the Start button the quiz begins. It offers 5 questions all of which are timed. You lose points if you do not answer correctly. Once you are done with your quiz you are presented with your score. You then have a oppertunity to registar your score in  the high score area with your initials. The high score area will hold the highscores until they are erased with the clear button. Both the clear button and return button will reset the game. The return button will not erase the highscores, unlike the clear button.
